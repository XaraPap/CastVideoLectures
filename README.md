# CastVideoLectures

Android application for casting video lectures.

In this application an educational video lecture system, where lectures are projected on TV, while additional information is projected on a secondary screen / device, in order to facilitate the learning process, is designed and developed.

This project is the tool used for the experimental conduction, performed for my Master Thesis.
The application development was based on “CastVideos-android” project (https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-android), in which i performed all the necessary changes, so as to implement the desired functionality.

The application functions with 2 ways, which differentiate in the interface of the display of additional information on the secondary screen (manual switching / synchronized with the video lecture).
